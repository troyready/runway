#####
Hooks
#####

A :class:`~cfngin.hook` is a python function, class, or class method that is executed before or after an action is taken for the entire config.

Only the following actions allow pre/post hooks:

:build:
  using fields :attr:`~cfngin.config.pre_build` and :attr:`~cfngin.config.post_build`
:destroy:
  using fields :attr:`~cfngin.config.pre_destroy` and :attr:`~cfngin.config.post_destroy`

.. class:: cfngin.hook

  When defining a hook in one of the supported fields, the follow fields can be used.

  .. rubric:: Lookup Support

  The following fields support lookups:

  - :attr:`~cfngin.hook.args`

  .. attribute:: args
    :type: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    :value: {}

    A dictionary of arguments to pass to the hook.

    This field supports the use of :ref:`lookups <cfngin-lookups>`.

    .. important::
      :ref:`Lookups <cfngin-lookups>` that change the order of execution, like :ref:`output <output lookup>`, can only be used in a *post* hook but hooks like :ref:`rxref <xref lookup>` are able to be used with either *pre* or *post* hooks.

  .. attribute:: data_key
    :type: Optional[str]

    If set, and the hook returns data (a dictionary), the results will be stored in :attr:`Context.hook_data <runway.cfngin.context.Context.hook_data>` with the ``data_key`` as its key.

  .. attribute:: enabled
    :type: Optional[bool]
    :value: true

    Whether to execute the hook every CFNgin run.
    This field provides the ability to execute a hook per environment when combined with a variable.

    .. rubric:: Example
    .. code-block:: yaml

      pre_build:
        example-hook:
          enabled: ${enable_example_hook}

  .. attribute:: path
    :type: str

    Python importable path to the hook.

    .. rubric:: Example
    .. code-block:: yaml

      pre_build:
        example-hook:
          path: runway.cfngin.hooks.command.run_command

  .. attribute:: required
    :type: Optional[bool]
    :value: true

    Whether to stop execution if the hook fails.

acm.Certificate
===============

.. rubric:: Requirements

- Route 53 hosted zone

    - authoritative for the domain the certificate is being created for
    - in the same AWS account as the certificate being created


.. rubric:: Description

Manage a DNS validated certificate in AWS Certificate Manager.

When used in the :attr:`~cfngin.config.pre_build` or :attr:`~cfngin.config.post_build` stage this hook will create a CloudFormation stack containing a DNS validated certificate.
It will automatically create a record in Route 53 to validate the certificate and wait for the stack to complete before returning the ``CertificateArn`` as hook data.
The CloudFormation stack also outputs the ARN of the certificate as ``CertificateArn`` so that it can be referenced from other stacks.

When used in the :attr:`~cfngin.config.pre_destroy` or :attr:`~cfngin.config.post_destroy` stage this hook will delete the validation record from Route 53 then destroy the stack created during a deploy stage.

If the hook fails during a deploy stage (e.g. stack rolls back or Route 53 can't be updated) all resources managed by this hook will be destroyed.
This is done to avoid orphaning resources/record sets which would cause errors during subsequent runs.
Resources effected include the CloudFormation stack it creates, ACM certificate, and Route 53 validation record.

.. rubric:: Hook Path

``runway.cfngin.hooks.acm.Certificate``


.. rubric:: Args

**alt_names (Optional[List[str]])**
    Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the ACM certificate.
    For example, you can add *www.example.net* to a certificate for which the ``domain`` field is
    *www.example.com* if users can reach your site by using either name.

**domain (str)**
    The fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as *www.example.com*, with which you want to secure an ACM certificate.
    Use an asterisk (``*``) to create a wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the same domain.
    For example, *\*.example.com* protects *www.example.com*, *site.example.com*, and *images.example.com*.

**hosted_zone_id (str)**
    The ID of the Route 53 Hosted Zone that contains the resource record sets that you want to change.
    This must exist in the same account that the certificate will be created in.

**stack_name (Optional[str])**
    Provide a name for the stack used to create the certificate. If not provided, the domain is used (replacing ``.`` with ``-``).
    If the is provided in a deploy stage, its needs to be provided in the matching destroy stage.

**ttl (Optional[int])**
    The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. (*default:* ``300``)


.. rubric:: Example
.. code-block:: yaml

    namespace: example
    cfngin_bucket: ''

    sys_path: ./

    pre_build:
      acm-cert:
        path: runway.cfngin.hooks.acm.Certificate
        required: true
        args:
          domain: www.example.com
          hosted_zone_id: ${rxref example-com::HostedZone}

    stack:

        class_path: blueprints.sampleapp.BlueprintClass
        variables:
          cert_arn: ${rxref www-example-com::CertificateArn}

    post_destroy:
      acm-cert:
        path: runway.cfngin.hooks.acm.Certificate
        required: true
        args:
          domain: www.example.com
          hosted_zone_id: ${rxref example-com::HostedZone}


aws_lambda.upload_lambda_functions
==================================

.. rubric:: Description

Build Lambda payloads from user configuration and upload them to S3.

Constructs ZIP archives containing files matching specified patterns for
each function, uploads the result to Amazon S3, then stores objects (of
type :class:`troposphere.awslambda.Code`) in the context's hook data,
ready to be referenced in blueprints.

Configuration consists of some global options, and a dictionary of function
specifications. In the specifications, each key indicating the name of the
function (used for generating names for artifacts), and the value
determines what files to include in the ZIP (see more details below).

If a ``requirements.txt`` or ``Pipfile/Pipfile.lock`` files are found at the root of the provided ``path``, the hook will use the appropriate method to package dependencies with your source code automatically. If you want to explicitly use ``pipenv`` over ``pip``, provide ``use_pipenv: true`` for the function.

Docker can be used to collect python dependencies instead of using system python to build appropriate binaries for Lambda.
This can be done by including the ``dockerize_pip`` configuration option which can have a value of ``true`` or ``non-linux``.

Payloads are uploaded to either a custom bucket or the CFNgin default
bucket, with the key containing it's checksum, to allow repeated uploads
to be skipped in subsequent runs.


.. rubric:: Hook Path

``runway.cfngin.hooks.aws_lambda.upload_lambda_functions``


.. rubric:: Args

**bucket (Optional[str])**
    Custom bucket to upload functions to. Omitting it will cause the default CFNgin bucket to be used.

**bucket_region (Optional[str])**
    The region in which the bucket should exist.
    If not given, the region will be either be that of the global ``cfngin_bucket_region`` setting, or else the region in use by the provider.

**prefix (Optional[str])**
    S3 key prefix to prepend to the uploaded zip name.

**follow_symlinks (Optional[bool])**
    Will determine if symlinks should be followed and included with the zip artifact. (*default:* ``False``)

**payload_acl (Optional[str])**
    The canned S3 object ACL to be applied to the uploaded payload. (*default: private*)

**functions (Dict[str, Any])**
    Configurations of desired payloads to build.
    Keys correspond to function names, used to derive key names for the payload.
    Each value should itself be a dictionary, with the following data:

    **docker_file (Optional[str])**
        Path to a local DockerFile that will be built and used for
        ``dockerize_pip``. Must provide exactly one of ``docker_file``,
        ``docker_image``, or ``runtime``.

    **docker_image (Optional[str])**
        Custom Docker image to use  with ``dockerize_pip``. Must
        provide exactly one of ``docker_file``, ``docker_image``, or
        ``runtime``.

    **dockerize_pip (Optional[Union[str, bool]])**
        Whether to use Docker when restoring dependencies with pip.
        Can be set to ``true``/``false`` or the special string ``non-linux``
        which will only run on non Linux systems.
        To use this option Docker must be installed.

    **exclude (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]])**
        Pattern or list of patterns of files to exclude from the
        payload. If provided, any files that match will be ignored,
        regardless of whether they match an inclusion pattern.

        Commonly ignored files are already excluded by default,
        such as ``.git``, ``.svn``, ``__pycache__``, ``*.pyc``,
        ``.gitignore``, etc.

    **include (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]])**
        Pattern or list of patterns of files to include in the
        payload. If provided, only files that match these
        patterns will be included in the payload.

        Omitting it is equivalent to accepting all files that are
        not otherwise excluded.

    **path (str)**
        Base directory of the Lambda function payload content.
        If it not an absolute path, it will be considered relative
        to the directory containing the CFNgin configuration file
        in use.

        Files in this directory will be added to the payload ZIP,
        according to the include and exclude patterns. If no
        patterns are provided, all files in this directory
        (respecting default exclusions) will be used.

        Files are stored in the archive with path names relative to
        this directory. So, for example, all the files contained
        directly under this directory will be added to the root of
        the ZIP file.

    **python_path (Optional[str])**
        Absolute path to a python interpreter to use for ``pip``/``pipenv``
        actions. If not provided, the current python interpreter will be used
        for ``pip`` and ``pipenv`` will be used from the current ``$PATH``.

    **runtime (Optional[str])**
        Runtime of the AWS Lambda Function being uploaded. Used with
        ``dockerize_pip`` to automatically select the appropriate
        Docker image to use. Must provide exactly one of
        ``docker_file``, ``docker_image``, or ``runtime``.

    **use_pipenv (Optional[bool])**:
        Will determine if pipenv will be used to generate requirements.txt
        from an existing Pipfile. To use this option pipenv must be installed.

*********************
Writing A Custom Hook
*********************

A custom hook must be in an executable, importable python package or standalone file.
The hook must be importable using your current ``sys.path``.
This takes into account the :attr:`~cfngin.config.sys_path` defined in the :class:`~cfngin.config` file as well as any ``paths`` of :attr:`~cfngin.config.package_sources`.

The hook must accept a minimum of two arguments, ``context`` and ``provider``.
Aside from the required arguments, it can have any number of additional arguments or use ``**kwargs`` to accept anything passed to it.
The values for these additional arguments come from the ``args`` key of the hook definition.

The hook must return ``True`` or a truthy object if it was successful.
It must return ``False`` or a falsy object if it failed.
This signifies to CFNgin whether or not to halt execution if the hook is ``required``.
If ``dict`` is returned, it can be accessed by subsequent hooks, lookups, or Blueprints from the context object.
It will be stored as ``context.hook_data[data_key]`` where ``data_key`` is the value set in the hook definition.
If ``data_key`` is not provided or the type of the returned data is not ``dict``, it will not be added to the context object.

If using boto3 in a hook, use ``context.get_session()`` instead of creating a new session to ensure the correct credentials are used.
