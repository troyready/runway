"""Retrieve a value from an environment variable.

The value is retrieved from a copy of the current environment variables
that is saved to the context object. These environment variables are
manipulated at runtime by Runway to fill in additional values such as
``DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT`` and ``AWS_REGION`` to match the current execution.

.. note:: ``DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT`` and ``AWS_REGION`` can only be resolved
          during the processing of a module. To ensure no error occurs
          when trying to resolve one of these in a :ref:`Deployment
          <runway-deployment>` definition, provide a default value.

If the Lookup is unable to find an environment variable matching the
provided query, the default value is returned or a ``ValueError`` is raised
if a default value was not provided.

.. rubric:: Arguments

This Lookup supports all :ref:`Common Lookup Arguments` but, the folling have
limited or no effect:

- region
